# ðŸ“§ Cold Mail Generator
Cold email generator for services company using groq, langchain and streamlit. It allows users to input the URL of a company's careers page. The tool then extracts job listings from that page and generates personalized cold emails. These emails include relevant portfolio links sourced from a vector database, based on the specific job descriptions. 

**Imagine a scenario:**

- Nike needs a Principal Software Engineer and is spending time and resources in the hiring process, on boarding, training etc
- Atliq is Software Development company can provide a dedicated software development engineer to Nike. So, the business development executive (Mohan) from Atliq is going to reach out to Nike via a cold email.

## Architecture Diagram

## Set-up
1. To get started we first need to get an API_KEY from here: https://console.groq.com/keys. Inside `app/.env` update the value of `GROQ_API_KEY` with the API_KEY you created. 


2. To get started, first install the dependencies using:
    ```commandline
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
## Tech Stack
- Backend
  - FastAPI (Python) â€“ REST API server (`app/server.py`)
  - LangChain + Groq (`langchain-groq`) â€“ LLM pipeline
  - ChromaDB â€“ simple vector store for portfolio matching
  - python-dotenv â€“ environment config
  - Uvicorn â€“ ASGI server
- Frontend
  - React 18 (TypeScript) â€“ UI in `ui/`
  - Vite â€“ dev server & bundler with proxy to backend
  - Tailwind CSS + PostCSS â€“ styling

## Environment Variables
Create an `.env` file in the project root or under `app/` with:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
USER_AGENT="cold-email-generator/1.0 (+https://your-site-or-email)"
TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Run the Backend (FastAPI)
From the project root:
```bash
uvicorn app.server:app --reload
```
This starts the API on http://localhost:8000

Useful endpoints:
- `GET /health` â€“ health check
- `POST /api/generate` â€“ body: `{ "url": "<job_url>" }`, returns `{ emails: string[] }`

## Run the Frontend (React + Vite)
From the `ui/` directory:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173 â€“ Vite proxies API calls to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Production Build
From `ui/`:
```bash
npm run build
```
This generates `ui/dist/`. The FastAPI server is configured to automatically serve this production build at the root path when present.

Then start the backend from the project root:
```bash
uvicorn app.server:app --reload
```
Open http://localhost:8000 to use the app (served from `ui/dist`).

## Legacy: Streamlit (optional)
You can still run the older Streamlit demo (not recommended if using the new React UI):
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```
